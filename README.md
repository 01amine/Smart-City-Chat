# Smart City Chat

**Smart City Chat** is a communication app designed for modern urban environments. It leverages a hybrid mesh network to ensure you stay connected with your city, your neighborhood, and your peers, even when traditional infrastructure fails.

## Features

### 🏙️ City Grid Communication
Connect with your local environment through Geohash-based channels. 
- **Local Channels**: Chat with people in your immediate city block, neighborhood, or city-wide.
- **Teleport**: Browse what's happening in other parts of the smart city.

### 📡 Resilient Mesh Network
Powered by advanced peer to peer technology:
- **Off Grid Capable**: Use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to chat with nearby peers without internet.
- **Anonymity Network**: Route traffic securely over Tor for privacy and reach.

### 🔒 Secure & Private
- **End to End Encryption**: Private messages are encrypted for your eyes only.
- **Verified Peers**: Use QR codes to verify the identity of the people you meet.
- **No Central Server**: You own your data.
